# Feature


<strong>TMKit</strong> supports researchers to analyze the problems involving transmembrane proteins by offering both commonly-used and bespoke methods that access their sequences, structures, topologies, etc. It has many features from both technical and biological perspectives. Technically, the library is written by an object-oriented programming (OOP) manner with its specific system for naming parameters. Biologically, we have been focusing on sorting out problems that are infested in a whole analysis process, regardless of whether they are small or big. We summarize the feature of TMKit in the following sections <strong>Nomenclature</strong> and <strong>What is TMKit focused most on</strong>.
