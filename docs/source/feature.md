:::{dropdown} Motivition
:open:

Computational analysis and modeling of transmembrane protein sequences and structures involve a complex workflow that requires integrating multiple tools for sequence alignment, topology prediction, structural analysis, and functional annotation. These tasks often demand extensive manual effort and switching between different software environments, making the process time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies.

:color: light

For this reason, we developed TMKit to offer a comprehensive and unified computational framework. It simplifies and standardises transmembrane protein analysis. TMKit consolidates various computational procedures under a single, intuitive interface, enabling researchers to efficiently perform sequence retrieval, topology parsing, structure comparison, and contact prediction without the need for multiple disparate tools.

TMKit provides currently nine modules to handle a number of transmembrane protein sequence and structural analysis problems, including visualization, sequence, quality control, topology, mapping, annotation, connectivity, edge extraction, and feature.
