# Overview


```{warning}
TMKit is an open-source Python programming interface, which is modular, scalable, and specifically designed for processing transmembrane protein data. It is a one-stop computational analysis tool for transmembrane proteins, enabling users to perform database wrangling, engineer features at the mutational, domain, and topological levels, and visualize protein-protein interaction interfaces through its unique programming interface. In addition, TMKit includes seqNetRR, a high-performance computing library that allows for customised construction and rewiring of residue connections. This library is particularly well-suited for assigning coevolutionary features at a fast speed.

TMKit offers quality control, I/O and collation of protein sequences/structures, sequence-predicted/structure-derived topologies, multiple sequence alignment generation, generation of canonical TM-specific features, visualization of protein structures and interfaces between TM proteins. Besides, other intriguing features of TMKit are the processing of functional (CATH), interactome, and mutational databases and more functionalities expected. It allows performance evaluation of residue-residue contact predictions.
