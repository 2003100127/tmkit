# PPI interface

Identification of protein-protein interaction (PPI) interfaces of proteins is critical to understand the biological processes governed by them. Direct visualization of the PPI interfaces on 3D structures can facilitate their localization at the atomic coordinate level. TMKit is an open-source toolkit that enables access to the PPI interfaces by taking as input the structure of a protein of interest (POI) and a list of probabilities of residue sites to be involved in interactions. The program can automatically generate the label- or propensity-based PPI interfaces in between a POI and its interacting proteins (or its larger complex), which can be visualised in [PyMOL](https://pymol.org).

TMKit allows users to visualize the structure-based interfaces between proteins in a complex. As shown in the plot below, we generate the PPI interfaces in this paper[^1].

:::{attention}
Visualization of PPI interfaces in TMKit relies on PyMOL but it is not installed by default. To use this function, you need to install PyMOL. There are two ways to install it very easily as below. We recommend installing it using an open-source PyMOL version ([pymol-open-source{octicon}`link-external;1em;sd-text-info`](https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source)). For more detail, see also [here{octicon}`link-external;1em;sd-text-info`](https://pymol.org/support.html#installation).
:::

```{code} python
# recommended option
conda install -c conda-forge pymol-open-source

# or
conda install -c schrodinger pymol
```

:::{tip}
Please make sure that [the build-in example dataset{octicon}`link-external;1em;sd-text-info`](../../get_started/example_dataset.md) has been downloaded before you walk through the tutorial.

## {octicon}`file-code;1em;sd-text-info` **Example usage**
After importing TMKit, the following command allows you to visualize the PPI interfaces of protein `6e3y` chain `E` with other chains in complex protein `6e3y`. The PPI interfaces are predicted using DeepTMInter[^2].

```{code} python
import tmkit as tmk

tmk.vs.protoc_deeptminter(
    prot_name='6e3y',
    prot_chain='E',
    pdb_chain_fp='data/pdb/',
    dist_fp='data/rrc/',
    pdb_complex_fp='data/pdb/pdbtm/',
    tool='deeptminter',
    draw_type='probability',
    isite_fp='data/isite/',
    sv_bfactor_fp='data/vs/bfactor/6e3y/',
    pymol_bg_chain_ids='B+C+J+K',
)
```

```{figure} ../../../img/6e3yE.png
:scale: 30%

**Caption**: Predicted PPI interfaces in green for `6e3y` chain `E` in complex with their interaction partners in red, respectively.
```


The keynote here is the input of predicted PPI interfaces. For your information, we show what this input file looks like below.

| Residue ID | Residue | Predicted probability |
|------------|---------|-----------------------|
| 1.0        | E       | 0.18815077418058843   |
| 2.0        | A       | 0.18221259814512925   |
| 3.0        | N       | 0.48554193714932137   |
| ...        | ...     | ...                   |
| 114.0      | K       | 0.7522871745416599    |
| 114.0      | R       | 0.7660381644357218    |

In fact, you can generate a file in this format if you have other predicted PPI interfaces by parameter `isite_fp`. Then, TMKit will recognize that anyway.

It should also be noticed that TMKit will use the Predicted PPI interfaces to generate a file that is recognized by PyMOL as saved in sv_bfactor_fp.
